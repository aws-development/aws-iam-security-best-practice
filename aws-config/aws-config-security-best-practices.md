Recommendation: Configure AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies or AWS Organizations SCPs to restrict AWS Management Console access to specific IP ranges or approved network locations.

Ensure AWS Lambda Functions Use Least Privilege Execution Roles:
Description: Verifies if AWS Lambda functions have execution roles with least privilege permissions.
Recommendation: Review and update execution roles for Lambda functions to grant only the necessary permissions required for their intended functionality and restrict unnecessary privileges.

Enable AWS CloudTrail Multi-Region Trail:
Description: Checks if AWS CloudTrail is configured with a multi-region trail to capture API activity across multiple regions.
Recommendation: Enable multi-region trails for AWS CloudTrail to capture a comprehensive audit trail of API activity and changes across all regions.

Ensure Auto Scaling Groups Use Secure AMIs:
Description: Verifies if Auto Scaling Groups are using secure and up-to-date Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for instances.
Recommendation: Regularly update and validate AMIs used by Auto Scaling Groups to ensure they come from trusted sources, are up to date with security patches, and meet your organization's security standards.

Restrict IAM Policies with Wildcard Actions:
Description: Checks if IAM policies have wildcard (*) actions, which can grant broad permissions and increase the risk of privilege escalation.
Recommendation: Review and modify IAM policies to avoid the use of wildcard actions and provide granular permissions based on the principle of least privilege.

Ensure AWS Config Rules are Evaluated Periodically:
Description: Verifies if AWS Config rules are evaluated periodically to detect non-compliant resources in a timely manner.
Recommendation: Configure AWS Config rules to be evaluated on a regular basis to ensure continuous compliance monitoring and prompt identification of non-compliant resources.

Enable Encryption for Amazon SNS Topics:
Description: Checks if Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topics are encrypted to protect the confidentiality of messages.
Recommendation: Enable encryption for SNS topics to ensure that messages sent via SNS are protected from unauthorized access.

Ensure CloudFront Distributions Use Secure SSL/TLS Protocols and Cipher Suites:
Description: Verifies if Amazon CloudFront distributions are configured with secure SSL/TLS protocols and cipher suites for secure content delivery.
Recommendation: Configure CloudFront distributions to use SSL/TLS protocols and cipher suites that provide strong encryption, perfect forward secrecy, and compliance with relevant security standards.

Restrict Amazon S3 Bucket Policies:
Description: Checks if Amazon S3 bucket policies have overly permissive access permissions that may expose data to unauthorized users.
Recommendation: Review and restrict the access permissions in S3 bucket policies to ensure that only authorized entities have the necessary privileges to access and manipulate data.

Ensure AWS Security Group Rules Use Specific IP Ranges:
Description: Verifies if security group rules use specific IP ranges instead of allowing access from all IP addresses (0.0.0.0/0).
Recommendation: Configure security group rules to restrict access by specifying specific IP ranges or trusted network addresses, minimizing the exposure to potential attackers.

Enable AWS CloudTrail Log File Validation:
Description: Checks if log file validation is enabled for AWS CloudTrail to detect unauthorized changes or tampering with log files.
Recommendation: Enable log file validation for AWS CloudTrail to ensure the integrity and non-repudiation of log data, providing evidence of any unauthorized modifications.

Restrict Cross-Account Access to S3 Buckets:
Description: Verifies if cross-account access to Amazon S3 buckets is properly restricted to prevent unauthorized access.
Recommendation: Configure appropriate S3 bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) to restrict cross-account access, allowing only authorized accounts to access the buckets.

Ensure AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Policies Do Not Allow Privilege Escalation:
Description: Checks if IAM policies have permissions that can lead to privilege escalation, allowing users to gain excessive privileges.
Recommendation: Review and update IAM policies to remove any permissions that can lead to privilege escalation, ensuring that users have only the necessary privileges required to perform their tasks.
